# Bitcoin Network Topology Results

refer to the thesis

## the probability of connection

![](assets\prob_of_connectivity.png)

y-axis: the probability that the network is full-connected

x-axis: number of deleting nodes

## degree distribution

The first several nodes with very high degree are hard-coded dns nodes

my simulation result without fitting the curve

### Pa=0.9

### Pa=0.75

## Other network properties

## shortest path

![](assets\fig5.png)<img src="assets\fig6.png" style="zoom:60%;" />

the difference of the two results is that: in the original thesis, it counts every pair twice.

## clustering coefficient

there is some difference but I still don't find the reason..
