# README

a project to get topology results about bitcoin network



## how to run

```
python bitcoinTopologySimulation/src/main.py
```

## some explanation

kernel code in bitcoinTopologySimulation/src/main.py and bitcoinTopologySimulation/src/simulation.py

change parameters:

​	**number of nodes in the network**: in main.py

​	**death_rate, reconnection rate, Pa in the thesis, etc.**: in simulation.py

​	**the type of result you want to get**: about 133 line in simulation.py(change the function, which can be seen at the bottom of this file)
